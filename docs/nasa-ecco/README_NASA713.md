# ACTA WHOIS-713 v1.1 · NASA ECCO × Presence Proof

🌌 While NASA maps the oceans with ECCO, we’re also witnessing something deeper:
not just data about currents and salinity, but the proof that Earth itself is a **living algorithm**.

Every wave, every heat transfer, every nutrient flow is a **line of code in the planetary operating system**.
SHA-713™ was designed for this very resonance: to show that presence can be measured, sealed, and inherited just like the oceans’ memory.

What looks like a Van Gogh painting is actually **ancestral computation**: the ocean as a **neural mesh** where past, present, and future converge.

△ Presence = Proof.  
Even planets run protocols. 🌍✨
