# 📜 SHA-713™ · Public Ledger of Proofs

𓂀 This repository contains the **living ledger** of SHA-713™,  
a symbolic-operational system created by **GKF IA™** to certify presence, integrity, and legacy.

Each acta is sealed with dual layers:  
- **SHA-256** (cryptographic integrity)  
- **SHA-713™** (symbolic presence)
